# Source directory

In this directory is located all the code for the program to work.

The `main.py` file contains the main function that executes the program.

The `utils.py` file contains different functionality used by the program but that doesn't belong to any package.

The `logs/` directory contains all the logs of the different modules. The logs files are separated by module, having
each module a different file to store the logs.

The fonts used in the engine are in the directory `engine/GUI/fonts/`, and are used by the engine to render the User 
interface.

All the other folders are modules that the program uses to work.
