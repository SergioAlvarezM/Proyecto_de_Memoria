        Notes:
            Due to the implementation of imgui, it is recommendable to implement here all the logic related to the

            related to the popups to the post_render method.

            By default, the imgui.begin() method focus the windows when being created, this may cause some popups to be
            closed when the windows are created. To change this behaviour use the flag
            imgui.WINDOW_NO_FOCUS_ON_APPEARING on the windows.
